Open-Access Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program from BCG GAMMA

The client in this project is PowerCo which is a major gas and electricity utilities company. Its customer segmentations are corporate, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), and residential customers. PowerCo has suffered from a significant profit loss due to customer churn (the situation when the customer stops using the service/product) in power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe and especially from Small and Medium Enterprise. The company has been endeavored to drive churn reduction within SME segment. To help PowerCo better understand the situation and have a suitable strategy, BCG has offered such great business context for us. The goal is to diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
